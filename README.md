**<h2>How to install them</h2>**

**<h3>If you have already installed them just run git pull in your .config directory!!! This makes your life much easier.</h3>**
You still need to run install.sh!
<br />
<br />

**<h3>The following dependencies are not installed by the install.sh script because they themselves are needed by the script</h3>**
